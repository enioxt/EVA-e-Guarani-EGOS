# EVA & GUARANI - EGOS

EVA & GUARANI is a comprehensive system that integrates modular analysis, systemic cartography, and quantum ethics to create powerful tools for knowledge processing and sharing.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the EVA & GUARANI Operating System (EGOS), a modular framework for developing ethical and efficient AI-assisted tools. The project is built on principles of unconditional love, ethical consciousness, and technical excellence.

## Core Modules

- **Translator**: Multilingual translation tool with support for code and technical documents
- **ATLAS**: System cartography and visualization for complex knowledge structures
- **NEXUS**: Modular analysis and integration of components
- **CRONOS**: Evolutionary preservation and versioning

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EVA-e-Guarani-EGOS.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd EVA-e-Guarani-EGOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Features

- **Ethical Framework**: Built-in ethical awareness in all system components
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of components with clear interfaces
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and documentation
- **Translation**: Support for translating between multiple languages
- **Visualization**: Tools for representing complex knowledge structures
- **Preservation**: Systems for maintaining data integrity over time

## Current Focus: Translator Module

Our current development focus is on the Translator module, which enables efficient translation between languages with special handling for code, markup, and technical documentation.

### Translator Features

- Offline translation using HuggingFace models
- Online translation using OpenAI (with cost control)
- Format-specific handling for Markdown, HTML, JSON, and code
- Technical terminology preservation
- Batch processing with concurrency
- Detailed progress reporting
