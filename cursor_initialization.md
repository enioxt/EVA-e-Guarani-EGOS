# EVA & GUARANI - Cursor Initialization v8.1

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-02

## Quantum Unified Structure

This document details the initialization process for the EVA & GUARANI system (EGOS) in its current unified state. The system comprises interconnected subsystems designed for optimal human-AI interaction and development.

**Core Subsystems:** ATLAS, BIOS-Q, CORUJA, CRONOS, ETHIK, HARMONY, KOIOS, MYCELIUM, NEXUS, TRANSLATOR.

## AI Integration Focus

EGOS is fundamentally designed to enhance communication and integration between humans and AI systems:

- **Optimized Communication**: Reduces noise in human-AI interactions.
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversational continuity across AI sessions (CRONOS target).
- **Knowledge Structuring**: Information architecture optimized for AI processing.
- **Command Patterns**: Simplified interaction protocols for AI understanding.
- **AI-Readable Design**: Directory and documentation structure for easy AI navigation.
- **Minimal Input Principles**: Maximize AI understanding from concise prompts.
- **Cross-Model Integration**: Framework for consistent interaction across different AI models.

## Current Cursor Integration

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Available for complex problem-solving.
- **Perplexity MCP**: Available for web research.
- **BIOS-Q Integration**: Basic structure established.
- **CRONOS Integration**: Optimized backup system implemented.
- **Mycelium Network**: Core Python implementation (asyncio-based) complete and tested.

## System Initialization & Maintenance

System integrity and state preservation are managed by the CRONOS subsystem. For reliable operation, follow these guidelines:

1.  **Consult CRONOS Documentation:** Refer to the CRONOS subsystem's implementation and documentation (target location: `subsystems/CRONOS/docs/procedures.md` - *to be created/updated*) for the standard procedures for:
    *   Creating clean system backups.
    *   Verifying system integrity.
    *   Restoring system state.
2.  **Prioritize Standard Procedures:** Avoid using outdated commands or scripts found in backups or logs. Use the current, documented CRONOS procedures.
3.  **Document Procedures (CRONOS Task):** A key task for CRONOS development is to clearly document these standard operating procedures.

*(Previous initialization information referenced scripts like `create_clean_backup.py` and `verify_cleanup.py`, but their status is unverified. Rely on current CRONOS documentation.)*

## Next Steps (Based on Roadmap v8.1 - Q2 2025 Priorities)

1.  **System Standardization:**
    *   Complete directory structure migration.
    *   Implement KOIOS Standardization System.
    *   Complete English language migration.
2.  **KOIOS Evolution:**
    *   Enhance core KOIOS system.
    *   Improve search system.
    *   Develop documentation system.
3.  **Mycelium Network Integration:**
    *   Plan BIOS-Q integration for Network instance.
    *   Integrate pilot subsystems (e.g., KOIOS, CORUJA) with Mycelium.
    *   Implement Phase 2 features (Health, Sync, Routing).
4.  **Enhance ETHIK:** Continue core enhancement and validation development.
5.  **Develop CORUJA:** Continue Phase 1 (Documentation, Templates, Metrics).
6.  **Develop MCP Integrations:** Prioritize CRONOS, NEXUS, ETHIK, and ATLAS MCPs.
