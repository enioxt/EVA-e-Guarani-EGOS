# KOIOS: Process for Code Evolution, Refactoring & Recovery

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active

## Goal

To ensure that refactoring, migration, unification, and backup processes preserve valuable code, history, and documentation, minimizing the risk of lost work and facilitating easier integration within the EGOS project.

## Principles

-   **Version Control First:** Git is primary.
-   **Clear Intent:** Define goals beforehand.
-   **Atomic Changes:** Use small, logical commits/branches.
-   **Non-Destructive:** Favor archiving over immediate deletion.
-   **Verification:** Test and review changes.
-   **Documentation:** Update docs concurrently.

## Process Steps

1.  **Planning & Branching:**
    *   Define clear goal.
    *   Identify *all* potential source files (current, backups, logs).
    *   Create a dedicated feature branch in Git.
2.  **Staging & Analysis (Non-Destructive):**
    *   *Copy* relevant historical/backup files to a temporary staging area (e.g., `temp_files/<task_name>_staging/`).
    *   Analyze and compare staged files with current target files (diff, manual review).
3.  **Integration & Refactoring (On Branch):**
    *   Selectively integrate/adapt code/logic from staged files into the target directory code.
    *   Refactor integrated code to meet current standards.
    *   Use small, frequent commits with clear messages.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Write or update unit/integration tests for the modified code.
    *   Run tests frequently on the feature branch.
5.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   Update READMEs, design docs, procedures, code comments *concurrently* on the feature branch.
    *   Update `ROADMAP.md` task status.
6.  **Cleanup & Archiving:**
    *   Verify integration is complete and staged files are incorporated.
    *   *Move* the source/staging directories used for recovery to `archives/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `archives/cronos_recovery_sources_YYYYMMDD/`). Avoid deleting original backups unless absolutely necessary and verified.
    *   Delete files from the *active* codebase only if they are confirmed to be replaced/obsolete.
7.  **Review & Merge:**
    *   Create Pull Request.
    *   Perform Code and Documentation Review.
    *   Merge upon approval.
