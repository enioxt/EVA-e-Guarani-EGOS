# Mycelium Network Subsystem

**Version:** 0.3 # Updated version
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-02

## Core Vision

The Mycelium Network is the core communication and integration fabric of the EGOS system. Inspired by natural mycelial networks, it enables seamless, adaptive, and resilient information flow between all subsystems, fostering emergent collaboration and collective intelligence.

## Key Objectives

-   Provide a unified communication bus for all subsystems.
-   Support various communication patterns (request/response, pub/sub, events).
-   Enable dynamic discovery and routing between subsystems.
-   Facilitate state synchronization and resource sharing where appropriate.
-   Ensure resilient and fault-tolerant communication.

## Existing Implementation (within SLOP Server)

An initial implementation of Mycelium Network concepts exists within the SLOP server (`src/services/slop/src/server/slop_server.js.backup`). This includes REST APIs and basic sync logic, serving as a reference.

## Status

-   **Core Implementation (Python/Asyncio):** Completed and unit tested (`network.py`, `node.py`, `interface.py`). Provides basic registration, connection management, and message routing (Req/Res, Pub/Sub).
-   **Design:** Consolidated design documented in `docs/protocol_design.md`.
-   **Next Steps:** Focus on integrating this core implementation with BIOS-Q and piloting subsystem connections (see main `ROADMAP.md`). Phase 2 features (advanced health, sync, routing) planned after initial integration.

## Basic Usage Examples (Conceptual)

These examples illustrate how a subsystem service might interact with the Mycelium network using the `MyceliumInterface`.

```python
import asyncio
from subsystems.MYCELIUM.interface import MyceliumInterface

# Assume configuration for node name, network address etc. is loaded
node_config = {
    "node_name": "ExampleServiceNode",
    "network_host": "127.0.0.1",
    "network_port": 61000, # Default Mycelium port
}

async def handle_incoming_message(topic: str, payload: dict):
    print(f"Received message on topic '{topic}': {payload}")
    # Process the message based on topic/payload
    pass

async def run_example_service():
    # 1. Initialize the interface for this service/node
    interface = MyceliumInterface(config=node_config)
    await interface.connect()
    print(f"Node {node_config['node_name']} connected to Mycelium.")

    # 2. Subscribe to relevant topics
    subscribe_topic = "event.system.startup"
    await interface.subscribe(subscribe_topic, handle_incoming_message)
    print(f"Subscribed to topic: {subscribe_topic}")

    # 3. Publish a message
    publish_topic = "request.data.process"
    message_payload = {"data_id": "123", "content": "Sample data"}
    print(f"Publishing to topic '{publish_topic}': {message_payload}")
    await interface.publish(publish_topic, message_payload)

    # Keep the service running (e.g., wait for keyboard interrupt)
    print("Service running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Service stopping...")
    finally:
        await interface.disconnect()
        print("Node disconnected.")

# To run this example, the Mycelium network (master node)
# needs to be running separately.
# asyncio.run(run_example_service())
