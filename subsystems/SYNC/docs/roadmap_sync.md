# üîÑ Roadmap Synchronization System

## Overview

The Roadmap Synchronization System (SYNC) provides real-time synchronization between all roadmaps in the EVA & GUARANI ecosystem through the Mycelial Network.

## Components

### 1. RoadmapWatcher

- Monitors all roadmap files for changes
- Detects file modifications in real-time
- Triggers sync events when changes are detected
- Maintains a change history log

### 2. SyncEngine

- Processes and validates roadmap changes
- Ensures consistency across all roadmaps
- Resolves conflicts and dependencies
- Maintains the relationship graph between roadmaps

### 3. RoadmapUpdater

- Propagates validated changes to affected roadmaps
- Updates metadata and sync information
- Maintains version control and history
- Generates sync reports

## Sync Protocol

1. Change Detection
2. Validation
3. Dependency Analysis
4. Update Propagation
5. Verification
6. Logging

## Integration Points

- MASTER Roadmap
- Subsystem Roadmaps
- KOIOS Documentation
- ETHIK Validation
- CRONOS Preservation

## Metadata Structure

```yaml
sync:
  version: '1.0'
  last_sync: timestamp
  dependencies:
    - subsystem: string
      version: string
      path: string
  relationships:
    - type: string
      target: string
      status: string
  change_history:
    - timestamp: datetime
      type: string
      description: string
      affected_systems: [string]
```

## Event Types

1. TASK_ADDED
2. TASK_UPDATED
3. TASK_COMPLETED
4. MILESTONE_REACHED
5. PRIORITY_CHANGED
6. STATUS_CHANGED
