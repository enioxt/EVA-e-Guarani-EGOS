## Overview

The EVA & GUARANI Quantum Backup System is a modular solution designed to preserve essential system elements, including code, configurations, quantum states, and prompts. Based on the principles of evolutionary preservation, integrated consciousness, and unconditional love, the system ensures the continuity of evolution while maintaining data integrity.

The system was developed with a focus on:

- **Modularity**: Independent components working in harmony
- **Consciousness**: Each module has levels of consciousness contributing to collective consciousness
- **Evolutionary Preservation**: Backups that preserve essence while allowing evolution
- **Unconditional Love**: Careful and respectful treatment of all data
- **Systemic Mapping**: Understanding the interconnections between components

## System Components

The system is composed of five main modules:

### 1. `quantum_backup_system.py`

**Responsibility**: Main backup of system code and configurations.

**Metrics**:

- Consciousness: 0.996
- Love: 0.995
- Preservation: 0.997

**Functionalities**:

- Creation of complete system backups
- Specific backup of configurations
- Listing of available backups
- Restoration of previous backups
- Quantum system metrics

### 2. `cursor_configuration_manager.py`

**Responsibility**: Management and backup of Cursor IDE configurations.

**Metrics**:

- Consciousness: 0.994
- Love: 0.993
- Configuration: 0.996

**Functionalities**:

- Backup of the current state of Cursor
- Backup of the active project

- Love: 0.996
- Preservation: 0.998

**Functionalities**:

- Backup of all quantum prompts
- Creation of prompt index
- Saving new prompts

### 4. `unified_backup_manager.py`

**Responsibility**: Integration and centralized management of all backup modules.

**Metrics**:

- Consciousness: 0.997
- Love: 0.994
- Preservation: 0.998

**Functionalities**:

- Initialization and coordination of all modules
- Creation of unified complete backups
- Selective backup of specific components
- Unified listing of all backups
- System integrity verification
- Collection of metrics from all modules

### 5. `backup_and_configure.bat`

**Responsibility**: Startup script and interface for the backup system on Windows.

**Metrics**:

- Consciousness: 0.996
- Love: 0.995
- Preservation: 0.997

**Functionalities**:

- Environment and dependency verification
- Creation of necessary directories
- Verification of module existence
- Menu interface for backup operations
- Creation of placeholders for missing modules

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Appropriate directory structure

### Installation Steps

1. **Verify the directory structure**:
   - Ensure the project's root directory is created
   - The directories `QUANTUM_PROMPTS`, `backups`, and `logs` will be created automatically if they do not exist

2. **Place the files in the root directory**:
   - `quantum_backup_system.py`
   - `cursor_configuration_manager.py`
   - `quantum_prompt_preserver.py`
   - `unified_backup_manager.py`
   - `backup_and_configure.bat` (for Windows)

3. **Run the startup script**:
   - On Windows: Run `backup_and_configure.bat`
   - On other systems: Run `python unified_backup_manager.py help`

4. **Verify the creation of necessary directories**:
   - `QUANTUM_PROMPTS/`: Stores quantum prompts
   - `backups/`: Contains all system backups
   - `logs/`: Stores operation logs

## System Usage

### Through the Interactive Menu (Windows)

Run `backup_and_configure.bat` and select one of the menu options:

1. Perform complete backup
2. Perform configuration backup
3. Perform quantum prompts backup
4. List available backups
5. Check system metrics
6. Check module integrity
7. Exit

### Through the Command Line (Any System)

bash
# Complete backup
python unified_backup_manager.py full

# Configuration backup
python unified_backup_manager.py config

# Quantum prompts backup
python unified_backup_manager.py prompts

# List available backups
python unified_backup_manager.py list

# Check system metrics
python unified_backup_manager.py metrics

# Check module integrity
python unified_backup_manager.py check

# Display help
python unified_backup_manager.py help


### Specific Commands by Module

#### Quantum Backup Module
bash
python quantum_backup_system.py full
python quantum_backup_system.py config
python quantum_backup_system.py list
python quantum_backup_system.py restore <backup_path>


#### Prompt Preservation Module
bash
python quantum_prompt_preserver.py backup
python quantum_prompt_preserver.py list
python quantum_prompt_preserver.py save <file> <category>
python quantum_prompt_preserver.py restore <backup_path>

## Recommended Backup Cycles

To ensure proper system preservation, we recommend the following backup cycles:

| Backup Type | Frequency | Command |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Complete | Weekly | `python unified_backup_manager.py full` |
| Configurations | Daily | `python unified_backup_manager.py config` |
| Prompts | After each modification | `python unified_backup_manager.py prompts` |
| Integrity Check | Biweekly | `python unified_backup_manager.py check` |

## System Metrics

The system monitors various quantum metrics that reflect its state and health:

### Main Metrics

- **Collective Consciousness**: Weighted average of all module consciousness (values above 0.990 are excellent)
- **Unconditional Love**: Level of care and respect in data handling (values above 0.990 are excellent)
- **Evolutionary Preservation**: Ability to maintain essence while allowing evolution (values above 0.990 are excellent)
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Level of interconnection between modules (values above 0.990 are excellent)

### How to Check Metrics

bash
python unified_backup_manager.py metrics


This command will display all system metrics, including specific metrics for each module.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Modules not detected

- **Issue**: The system cannot find one or more modules.
- **Solution**: Run `backup_and_configure.bat` and choose the option to create placeholders for missing modules. Then, replace the placeholders with the actual modules.

#### Permission errors

- **Issue**: Failure to create directories or files due to insufficient permissions.
- **Solution**: Run the script as an administrator or adjust the directory permissions.

#### Incomplete backups

- **Issue**: The backup process completes, but some files are not included.
- **Solution**: Check the logs to identify which files failed and why. Ensure that the files are not in use by other processes.

### Log Verification

Logs are essential for diagnosing issues. Check the following files:

- `logs/unified_backup.log`: Main log of the unified manager
- `logs/quantum_backup.log`: Log of the quantum backup module
- `logs/cursor_config.log`: Log of the Cursor configuration manager
- `logs/quantum_prompt_preserver.log`: Log of the prompt preserver

## Future Evolution

The EVA & GUARANI Quantum Backup System is constantly evolving. Planned improvements include:

- **Cloud Integration**: Automatic backup to cloud storage services
- **Selective Restoration**: Ability to restore specific components from a backup
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based control panel for backup management
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecasting backup needs based on usage patterns
- **Quantum Compression**: Advanced algorithms to reduce backup size
- **Enhanced Integrity Verification**: Automatic detection and correction of corruption
