# Deploying EVA & GUARANI to Loveable

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for taking the EVA & GUARANI sandbox environment and deploying it to Loveable, an AI-powered web development platform.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have:

1. A functioning local EVA & GUARANI sandbox environment
2. A Loveable account (create one at [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) if needed)
3. Your files organized and ready for deployment

## Step 1: Package Your Project

First, you need to prepare your project for deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Eva & Guarani - EGOS"

# Create a deployment package directory
mkdir deployment
cd deployment

# Copy the necessary files for deployment
mkdir -p sandbox/api sandbox/frontend sandbox/examples

# Copy the core files
cp -r ../sandbox/api/flask_api sandbox/api/
cp -r ../sandbox/frontend/html_basic sandbox/frontend/
cp -r ../sandbox/examples/basic_integration.py sandbox/examples/
cp ../sandbox/requirements.txt .
```

## Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository (Optional but Recommended)

Loveable works well with GitHub integration:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "eva-guarani-sandbox"
2. Initialize your local git repository and push to GitHub:

```bash
cd "C:\Eva & Guarani - EGOS\deployment"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for EVA & GUARANI Sandbox"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/eva-guarani-sandbox.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Loveable

Now you're ready to deploy to Loveable:

1. Log in to your Loveable account at [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
2. Create a new project:
   - Select "Create New Project"
   - Choose "Import from GitHub" if you followed Step 2, or "Upload Files" if not

3. If importing from GitHub:
   - Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
   - Select the "eva-guarani-sandbox" repository
   - Click "Import"

4. If uploading directly:
   - Zip your deployment directory
   - Upload the zip file to Loveable
   - Click "Import"

## Step 4: Configure Project in Loveable

After importing your project, you need to configure it:

1. In the Loveable dashboard, navigate to your project settings
2. Set the following configuration:
   - **Project Type**: Web Application
   - **Entry Point**: `sandbox/api/flask_api/app.py`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Environment Variables**:

     ```
     FLASK_APP=sandbox/api/flask_api/app.py
     FLASK_ENV=production
     FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0
     FLASK_PORT=5000
     ```

3. Click "Save Configuration"

## Step 5: Customize with Loveable AI

Loveable's AI capabilities can help enhance your project:

1. Use the Loveable editor to open your project
2. In the prompt field, ask Loveable to:
   - "Add responsive mobile design to the EVA & GUARANI frontend"
   - "Optimize the API endpoints for better performance"
   - "Add authentication to protect the API endpoints"

3. Review the AI-generated changes and apply the ones you want to keep

## Step 6: Deploy Your Application

Now you're ready to deploy:

1. In the Loveable dashboard, click "Deploy"
2. Choose your deployment settings:
   - **Environment**: Production
   - **Region**: Select the region closest to your users
   - **Custom Domain**: Configure if you have one (optional)

3. Click "Deploy Now"
4. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 7: Test Your Deployed Application

Once deployed, test your application to ensure everything works:

1. Visit the provided URL from Loveable
2. Test all main functions:
   - Check the status endpoint
   - Test ATLAS, NEXUS, CRONOS, and ETHIK module endpoints
   - Try the integration endpoint with a test payload

## Step 8: Share Your Application

Now that your application is deployed:

1. Copy the deployment URL from Loveable
2. Share it with your team or users
3. Consider adding the URL to your project documentation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure `flask-cors` is in your requirements.txt
   - Check the Loveable logs for any missing packages

2. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Verify CORS settings in your Flask application
   - Check for hardcoded localhost URLs in your frontend code

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Review the Loveable deployment logs
   - Ensure your app.py file is correctly specified as the entry point

## Next Steps

After successful deployment, consider:

1. Setting up a custom domain for your application
2. Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automatic deployments
3. Adding analytics to track usage of your application
4. Creating additional frontends using Loveable's AI features
