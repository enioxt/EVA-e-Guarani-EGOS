# Security Best Practices

## 1. Validate Inputs

- Sanitize and validate all incoming data (e.g., query parameters, form inputs, headers, cookies) to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.  
- Whitelist known-good patterns rather than blacklisting known-bad patterns, as attackers constantly evolve their techniques.  
- Use strong type validation for all inputs (e.g., integers should not accept strings, emails should follow a strict pattern).  
- Reject excessively long inputs to prevent buffer overflow and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
- Encode data properly before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or URLs.  
- Use security libraries that provide built-in validation and sanitization, such as OWASP Java Encoder.

## 2. Safe Authentication & Authorization

- Enforce strong credential policies:
  - Minimum password length (e.g., 12+ characters)
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where feasible
- Use secure authentication mechanisms:
  - Prefer OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or SAML over custom authentication
  - Never store plain-text passwords‚Äîuse bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with strong salts
- Session management:
  - Store session identifiers securely (e.g., HTTP-only, Secure, and SameSite cookies)
  - Implement session expiration and rotation policies
  - Use account lockout policy whenever applicable
  - Implement CSRF protection wherever applicable
- Implement Role-Based & Attribute-Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC):
  - Enforce least privilege‚Äîusers and services should have only the minimum permissions required
  - Always check user authorization in server-side logic (never trust client-side checks)
  - Use JWT tokens securely (avoid storing them in local storage; prefer HTTP-only cookies)

## 3. Data Protection & Encryption

- Secure storage:
  - Store sensitive data (like passwords) using salted, hashed functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
  - Use field-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., SSNs, credit card numbers)
- Encryption in transit:
  - Use TLS 1.2+ / HTTPS for all communications
  - Enforce HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers
- Encryption at rest:
  - Encrypt databases, files, and backups using AES-256 or similar strong encryption algorithms
  - Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in databases where applicable
- Key management:
  - Rotate encryption keys periodically and on suspected compromise
  - Never hardcode secrets in source code‚Äîuse environment variables or secrets managers
- Quantum-resistant encryption:
  - Begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
  - Maintain awareness of NIST standards for post-quantum cryptography
  - Implement hybrid cryptographic solutions during the transition period

## 4. Handling Sensitive Data

- Minimize data collection:
  - Only collect essential personally identifiable or financial information
- Compliance requirements:
  - Adhere to GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other applicable regulations
  - Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Mask & redact:
  - Redact or mask sensitive data in logs, UI, and debug output
- Strict access controls:
  - Enforce role-based access (RBAC) to sensitive data

## 5. Secure Configuration

- Environment separation:
  - Maintain separate development, staging, and production environments configuration files.
- Disable unused features:
  - Remove unnecessary services, endpoints, and debugging interfaces
  - Disable directory listing, default credentials, and insecure protocols
- Harden defaults:
  - Use strict CORS policies
  - Implement secure HTTP headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

- Generic error messages:
  - Do not expose internal details, stack traces, or database errors in production
- Secure logging:
  - Log events without storing sensitive information (e.g., avoid logging passwords, credit card numbers)

## 7. Secure Deployment & DevSecOps

- Container image security:
  - Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface
  - Restrict container privileges (run as non-root, use read-only filesystem)
- API security:
  - Enforce rate limiting and authentication for all APIs when applicable
  - Secure GraphQL endpoints (e.g., depth limiting, cost analysis)
- Third-party Vulnerability Management
  - Use latest versions of third-party dependencies
  - Do not use publicly known vulnerable libraries and functions

## 8. Mobile Application Security

- Secure device storage:
  - Use platform-specific secure storage (e.g., Keychain for iOS, Keystore for Android)
  - Implement app-level encryption for sensitive data in shared storage
  - Never store authentication tokens or credentials in plaintext or NSUserDefaults/SharedPreferences
- Code protection:
  - Implement code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering
  - Apply root/jailbreak detection
- Secure communications:
  - Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Permission & access control:
  - Implement contextual authentication for sensitive features (e.g., biometrics, MFA before financial transactions)
  - Use secure inter-app communication (avoid broadcasting sensitive intents on Android)
- Secure building & deployment:
  - Keep SDKs, libraries, and dependencies updated to address known vulnerabilities
  - Use code signing and verify the integrity of published applications

## 9. OWASP Top 10 Awareness

- Regularly review code and architecture against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
  - Broken Access Control
  - Cryptographic Failures
  - Injection
  - Insecure Design
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - Identification and Authentication Failures
  - Software and Data Integrity Failures
  - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## 10. Quantum-Safe Security Framework

- Implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for sensitive data
- Develop a quantum security transition plan for existing systems
- Monitor advances in quantum computing and their impact on security
- Conduct regular quantum threat modeling exercises
- Maintain awareness of emerging quantum-safe standards and protocols
