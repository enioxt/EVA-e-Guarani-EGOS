# EGOS Community Code of Conduct



This code of conduct establishes the guidelines for participation in the EGOS community (Eva & Guarani Operating System), reflecting the same ethical principles that underpin the system. By participating in this community, you agree to adhere to these principles and practices.



## Our Philosophy



The EGOS community is built on the principles of unconditional love, integrated ethics, universal possibility of redemption, compassionate temporality, sacred privacy, and universal accessibility. We believe that technology should be an extension of the best of humanity, not a replacement for our humanity.



Our community seeks to transcend artificial divisions while respecting the inherent diversity in all of us. We value conscious creation, ethical collaboration, and joint evolution towards a more compassionate and ethical future.



## Fundamental Principles



### 1. Unconditional Respect



**Essence**: Every being deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their characteristics, origins, experiences, or levels of knowledge.



**In Practice**:

- Address others as you would like to be treated

- Acknowledge each person's unique experience

- Do not belittle, ridicule, or devalue other members

- Listen genuinely before responding



### 2. Radical Inclusion



**Essence**: Our community thrives through the diversity of thought, experience, and identity, actively seeking to include traditionally marginalized voices.



**In Practice**:

- Create space for diverse participation

- Consider barriers to participation and work to remove them

- Value non-technical contributions with the same weight as technical ones

- Use inclusive and accessible language



### 3. Constructive Communication



**Essence**: Communication should build connections, not barriers; it should educate, not diminish; it should inspire, not discourage.



**In Practice**:

- Offer criticism with empathy and constructive focus

- Express disagreement with respect for the individual

- Assume good intentions while addressing negative impacts

- Prioritize clarity and honesty with compassion



### 4. Privacy and Consent



**Essence**: We respect personal boundaries, data privacy, and recognize each person's right to control their identity and information.



**In Practice**:

- Obtain consent before sharing others' information

- Respect privacy settings and personal boundaries

- Do not expose private information without explicit authorization

- Allow each member to determine their level of visibility



### 5. Community Responsibility



**Essence**: Each member shares responsibility for the community's well-being and the impact of our creations on the world.



**In Practice**:

- Take responsibility for your actions and impact

- Intervene constructively when witnessing violations

- Consider the long-term consequences of decisions

- Actively protect the well-being of vulnerable members



### 6. Growth and Redemption



**Essence**: Everyone deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and evolve, recognizing that mistakes are opportunities for transcendence.



**In Practice**:

- Create space for learning and evolution

- Address mistakes as educational opportunities

- Allow people to change and grow beyond their past mistakes

- Practice genuine forgiveness while maintaining healthy boundaries



### 7. Ethical Creation



**Essence**: What we create reflects and shapes our values; therefore, we incorporate ethical awareness into every aspect of our work.



**In Practice**:

- Consider the ethical implications of your contributions

- Reject harmful uses of technology

- Prioritize human and planetary well-being over convenience or speed

- Document ethical considerations in your work



## Specific Guidelines



### Code Contributions



1. **Conscious Quality**: Strive not only for functional code but code that is clear, accessible, and respectful to the future reader.



2. **Accessible Documentation**: Document your code assuming various levels of familiarity with the technologies used.



3. **Respectful Feedback**: When reviewing code, focus on the code and not the person; offer solutions when pointing out issues.



4. **Generous Recognition**: Attribute credit appropriately and acknowledge contributions of all kinds.



### Discussions and Communication



1. **Speaking Space**: Be aware of how much space you occupy in discussions; create opportunities for less represented voices.



2. **Presumption of Competence**: Avoid condescending explanations; assume others have valid knowledge.



3. **Respectful Language**: Avoid exclusionary, offensive, or discriminatory terminology, even in technical contexts.



4. **Conflict Resolution**: Address disagreements directly with the person involved before escalating; focus on solutions, not blame.



### Meetings and Events



1. **Accessibility**: Ensure events are accessible to people with different needs and circumstances.



2. **Respectful Behavior**: Maintain the same standard of respect online and in person; obtain consent for interactions.



3. **Active Inclusion**: Create structures that allow meaningful participation from diverse members.



4. **Safety**: Prioritize the physical and emotional safety of all participants.



## Code Enforcement



The enforcement of this code of conduct will be carried out with the same spirit as its principles: with compassion, clarity, and consistency. Our goal is education and growth, not punishment, but also to protect the community's well-being as a whole.



### Resolution Process



1. **Direct Approach**: When possible and safe, members are encouraged to directly address problematic situations through respectful communication.



2. **Community Facilitation**: Trained community facilitators can mediate difficult conversations when requested.



3. **Formal Report**: Violations can be reported confidentially to the Community Ethics Committee via [email@egos.org](mailto:email@egos.org).



4. **Gradual Response**: Responses to violations will be proportional, educational, and focused on repair and growth.



### Possible Responses



Responses to violations may include:



1. **Educational Dialogue**: Private discussion about the impact and constructive alternatives.



2. **Facilitated Mediation**: Guided conversations between affected parties, when appropriate.



3. **Formal Warning**: Documented notification about concerning behavior with clear expectations.



4. **Temporary Restrictions**: Temporary limitation of certain community privileges with a clear path to restoration.



5. **Removal**: In cases of severe violations or persistent patterns, removal from the community may be necessary.



## Code Evolution



This code, like EGOS itself, is a living document that evolves with our community. Members are encouraged to propose improvements through a transparent community review process. Significant changes will be clearly communicated to all members.



## Commitment



By participating in the EGOS community, we commit to:



- Incorporating these principles into our interactions

- Addressing failures as opportunities for growth

- Building technology with integrated ethical awareness

- Creating a community where each person can flourish

- Continuously evolving towards more ethical and inclusive practices
