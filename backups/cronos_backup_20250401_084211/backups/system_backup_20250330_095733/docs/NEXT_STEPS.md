# Next Steps - EVA & GUARANI

*Date: 03/19/2025*

This document details the recommended next steps to continue the development and maintenance of the EVA & GUARANI system after the structural reorganization.

## üìä Current Status Summary

The reorganization of the EVA & GUARANI system was successfully completed, resulting in:

- Removal of 15,448 obsolete files
- Consolidation of 104 duplicate files
- Implementation of a modular structure with 8 main categories and 43 subcategories
- Creation of comprehensive documentation and versioning strategy
- Development of automation scripts for system maintenance

## üîß Short-Term Activities (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Reference Update

- [ ] Verify and update imports in Python files
- [ ] Update links in documentation files
- [ ] Correct relative paths in automation scripts
- [ ] Validate configurations that reference file paths

python
# Example of import update

# Before

from egos.core import system_functions

# After

from core.egos.system_functions import function_name


### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Verify bot functionality after reorganization
- [ ] Test integrations with external APIs
- [ ] Validate functionality of main subsystems
- [ ] Perform regression tests

### 3. Backup Policy Implementation

- [ ] Configure automatic daily backup (03:00h)
- [ ] Implement script for pre-version backup
- [ ] Establish retention policy (30 days for daily, indefinite for versions)
- [ ] Test restoration process

## üóìÔ∏è Medium-Term Activities (1-2 months)

### 1. Unit Testing

- [ ] Develop tests for the core/egos subsystem
- [ ] Add tests for critical modules
- [ ] Implement tests for main integrations
- [ ] Set up automated test environment

python
# Example of unit test

import unittest

from core.egos.system_functions import function_name

class TestSystemFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_function_behavior(self):

        result = function_name("test")

        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)


### 2. Technical Documentation

- [ ] Create architecture diagrams for each subsystem
- [ ] Develop detailed guides for developers
- [ ] Document processing flows
- [ ] Create operation manuals

### 3. Continuous Integration Pipeline

- [ ] Set up CI/CD environment
- [ ] Implement code quality checks
- [ ] Automate test execution
- [ ] Configure deployment in test environment

### 4. Code Governance

- [ ] Define coding standards
- [ ] Implement code review process
- [ ] Establish workflows for new features
- [ ] Create templates for issues and pull requests

## üìà Long-Term Activities (3-6 months)

### 1. Data Governance

- [ ] Develop retention and privacy policies
- [ ] Implement audit mechanisms
- [ ] Establish security protocols
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plans

### 2. Quality Metrics

- [ ] Implement static code analysis
- [ ] Monitor test coverage
- [ ] Track complexity metrics
- [ ] Establish KPIs for code quality

### 3. Feature Expansion

- [ ] Review product roadmap
- [ ] Prioritize new features
- [ ] Plan subsystem expansions
- [ ] Evaluate integration with new technologies

### 4. Scalability

- [ ] Analyze bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Plan horizontal scalability strategy
- [ ] Consider microservices-based architecture

## üìÖ Progress Monitoring

To ensure activities are being carried out as planned, it is recommended to:

1. **Weekly Meetings**: Review progress and adjust priorities
2. **Progress Dashboard**: Maintain a visual panel with activity status
3. **Monthly Reports**: Document advances and challenges encountered
4. **Quarterly Reviews**: Evaluate alignment with strategic objectives

## üéØ Strategic Objectives

By following these next steps, the EVA & GUARANI project aims to achieve the following strategic objectives:

1. **Technical Excellence**: High-quality, well-tested, and documented code
2. **Modularity**: Decoupled and reusable components
3. **Sustainability**: Processes that ensure continuous maintenance and evolution
4. **Accessibility**: System understandable and usable by different audiences
5. **Integrated Ethics**: Ethical principles incorporated in all aspects
