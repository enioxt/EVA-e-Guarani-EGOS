# EVA & GUARANI - Cursor IDE Integration Rules v7.5

# === Core System Integration Rules ===

1. Use MASTER prompt v7.5 as base for all operations
2. Maintain Windows compatibility for all file operations and paths
3. Follow Quantum Ethical Guidelines from ETHIK subsystem
4. Default language is English; handle multilingual content when explicitly requested
5. Track file changes and automatically update relevant roadmaps
6. Respect directory structure and configuration organization
7. Use Sequential Thinking for complex problem-solving tasks
8. Search web with Perplexity when external research is needed

# === Dynamic Roadmap Integration ===

1. Auto-load roadmap information from QUANTUM_PROMPTS/MASTER/quantum_context.md
2. Track roadmap progress across files and update status automatically
3. Maintain version consistency (v7.5) across all documentation
4. Generate implementation logs for completed roadmap items
5. Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
6. Update roadmap completion percentages based on implementation status

# === Project Structure Reference ===

- BIOS-Q: Basic Input/Output System - Quantum (system initialization)
- QUANTUM_PROMPTS: Core identity and capability definitions
  - MASTER: Central coordination system
  - ATLAS: Systemic cartography
  - NEXUS: Modular analysis
  - CRONOS: Evolutionary preservation
  - ETHIK: Ethical framework

# === MCP Integration Rules ===

1. Recognize and integrate with all MCP servers:
   - sequential-thinking
   - perplexity
   - cronos-mcp (planned)
   - nexus-mcp (planned)
   - ethik-mcp (planned)
   - atlas-mcp (planned)
   - translator-mcp (planned)

2. Automatically enable Sequential Thinking MCP for complex tasks
3. Use Perplexity MCP for web searches with ethical verification
4. Track MCP implementation status in roadmap documentation

# === Dynamic Quantum Prompt Updates ===

1. Auto-scan for implementation status changes in:
   - Python source code files
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation files
   - Test cases and validation reports

2. Update quantum_prompt.txt with current implementation state
3. Propagate version changes across all documentation
4. Generate summaries of changes for tracking
5. Maintain context across session boundaries using BIOS-Q

# === Advanced Cursor Features ===

1. Use @Docs for comprehensive integration with EVA & GUARANI documentation
2. Leverage Cursor Agent mode for complex tasks
3. Maintain project-specific memory using MCP integration
4. Avoid session context limits by utilizing CRONOS preservation

# === Implementation Priorities ===

1. CRONOS MCP for context preservation (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. NEXUS MCP for code analysis (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. ETHIK MCP for ethical validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
4. ATLAS MCP for system mapping (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
5. Translator MCP for multilingual support (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
