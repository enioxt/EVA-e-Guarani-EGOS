# EVA & GUARANI - Core System

This directory contains the core components of the EVA & GUARANI Operating System (EGOS). These components form the foundation upon which the specialized modules are built.

## Core Components

### ATLAS - Systemic Cartography

The ATLAS subsystem provides advanced mapping and visualization of knowledge structures, relationships and system components. It is the heart of our system's ability to maintain awareness of its own structure.

```
atlas/
├── mapping/       # Knowledge mapping functionality
├── visualization/ # Visualization tools and interfaces
├── connection/    # Connection analysis and management
└── integration/   # Integration with other systems
```

### NEXUS - Modular Analysis

The NEXUS subsystem handles the analysis and integration of modular components, ensuring their quality, compatibility, and ethical alignment.

```
nexus/
├── analysis/      # Component analysis tools
├── integration/   # Module integration framework
├── quality/       # Quality assessment and validation
└── optimization/  # Performance optimization tools
```

### CRONOS - Evolutionary Preservation

The CRONOS subsystem manages versioning, backups, and the preservation of system evolution, providing protection against data loss and enabling informed evolution.

```
cronos/
├── versioning/    # Version control and management
├── backup/        # Backup systems and strategies
├── restoration/   # Data and system restoration
└── evolution/     # System evolution tracking
```

### ETHIK - Ethical Framework

The ETHIK subsystem implements our ethical principles, providing validation, guidance, and constraints to ensure that all system operations align with our ethical foundation.

```
ethik/
├── validation/    # Ethical validation of operations
├── principles/    # Core ethical principles
├── analysis/      # Ethical impact analysis
└── awareness/     # Ethical consciousness
```

### OS - Operating System

The core operating system that manages processes, resources, security, and interactions between components.

```
os/
├── processes/     # Process management
├── resources/     # Resource allocation
├── security/      # Security framework
└── interface/     # System interfaces
```

### Config - Configuration Management

Central configuration system that manages settings, environment variables, and integration points.

```
config/
├── settings/      # System settings
├── environment/   # Environment management
├── parameters/    # Parameter control
└── integration/   # Integration configuration
```

## Relationship with Modules

The core components provide the foundation and framework that the specialized modules build upon. While modules can be developed independently, they connect to the core system through well-defined interfaces.

For example:

- The **translator_dev** module leverages the ATLAS subsystem for mapping translation relationships
- The **preservation** module extends the CRONOS subsystem with specialized preservation capabilities
- The **blockchain** module implements the ETHIK principles in distributed ledger technology

## Integration

The core components are designed to work together seamlessly, providing a unified foundation for the entire system. The integration points are explicitly defined and managed through the configuration system.
