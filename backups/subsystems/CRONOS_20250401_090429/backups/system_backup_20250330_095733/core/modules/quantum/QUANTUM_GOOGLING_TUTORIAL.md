## üåü Introduction to Quantum Googling

Quantum Googling is a specialized subsystem of EVA & GUARANI v7.4 designed to conduct ethical, deep, and multidimensional web searches. Unlike conventional search methods, Quantum Googling processes queries through an ethical matrix, verifies source credibility, preserves proper attribution, and integrates results directly into your knowledge ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Multidimensional Ethical Search**: Searches multiple sources with ethical verification
- **Source Validation**: Analyzes the credibility and relevance of information
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Semantic processing of results
- **Automatic Citation**: Proper attribution of all used sources
- **Quantum Integration**: Direct connection with ATLAS, NEXUS, and Obsidian

## üí† Ethical Principles of Quantum Research

Quantum Googling operates under the following ethical principles:

1. **Respect for Intellectual Property**: All knowledge has an origin and must be properly attributed
2. **Information Verification**: Data is validated through multiple sources when possible
3. **Avoidance of Harmful Content**: Ethical filtering of potentially harmful content
4. **Privacy**: No personal data is stored or shared during searches
5. **Transparency**: All sources are clearly documented and accessible
6. **Diversity of Perspectives**: Active search for multiple viewpoints on complex topics

## üß© System Structure

Quantum Googling is structured into three main components:

mermaid
graph TD
    QG[Quantum Googling] --> WR[Web Research]
    QG --> SV[Source Validation]
    QG --> KE[Knowledge Extraction]
    
    WR --> SE1[Search Engine 1]
    WR --> SE2[Search Engine 2]
    WR --> SE3[Search Engine 3]
    
    SV --> CS[Credibility Score]
    SV --> RS[Relevance Score]
    SV --> ES[Ethical Score]
    
    KE --> PS[Parsing System]
    KE --> SS[Summarization]
    KE --> CM[Connection Mapping]
    
    CM --> ATLAS
    SS --> OBSIDIAN
    PS --> NEXUS


### Detailed Components

1. **Web Research**
   - Manages queries across multiple search engines
   - Balances results for source diversity
   - Applies initial ethical filters to results

2. **Source Validation**
   - Evaluates the credibility of each source
   - Determines relevance to the specific query
   - Applies secondary ethical checks

3. **Knowledge Extraction**
   - Processes and structures obtained information
   - Generates summaries of varying complexity levels
   - Maps connections with existing knowledge

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

To customize Quantum Googling beyond basic settings, edit the `config/quantum_googling_advanced.json` file:

    "depth": 3,
    "results_per_engine": 10,
    "timeout_seconds": 30,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "cache_duration_hours": 24
  },
  "source_validation": {
    "credibility_threshold": 0.7,
    "relevance_threshold": 0.6,
    "ethical_threshold": 0.8,
    "cross_verification": true,
    "trust_domains": [
      "*.edu",
      "*.gov",
      "scholar.google.com",
      "wikipedia.org"
    ]
  },
  "knowledge_extraction": {
    "summarization_levels": [
      "brief",
      "detailed",
      "comprehensive"
    ],
    "extract_images": true,
    "extract_tables": true,
    "extract_code_blocks": true,
    "create_connections": true,
    "connection_threshold": 0.6
  },
  "language_processing": {
    "translation_enabled": true,
    "languages": ["en", "pt", "es", "fr", "de"],
    "sentiment_analysis": true,
    "entity_recognition": true
  }
}


## üîç Commands and Syntax

### Basic Commands

bash
# Basic search
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "your question here"

# Search with source filter
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "your question" --sources academic

# Search with output to Obsidian
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "your question" --export obsidian

# Search with connection to ATLAS
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "your question" --connect atlas


### Advanced Query Syntax

Quantum Googling supports advanced syntax to refine your queries:

- **"exact term"**: Searches for the term exactly as written
- **term1 AND term2**: Both terms must be present
- **term1 OR term2**: At least one of the terms must be present
- **term1 NOT term2**: The first term without the second
- **site:domain.com**: Restricts the search to the specific domain
- **filetype:pdf**: Restricts the search to the specified file type
- **@ethical**: Prefix that prioritizes sources with high ethical scores
- **#science**: Prefix that categorizes the search in a specific domain

### Advanced Syntax Examples


"ethics in artificial intelligence" AND (benefits OR risks) NOT "sci-fi" @ethical #science


This query searches for the exact term "ethics in artificial intelligence" along with "benefits" or "risks", excluding results mentioning "sci-fi", prioritizing ethical sources and categorizing the search in the scientific domain.

## üîó Integrations

### Integration with Obsidian

Quantum Googling can export results directly to your Obsidian vault:

bash
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "history of Brazil" --export obsidian --template research


This creates a note in Obsidian using the "research" template and fills it with the search results, including citations and links to original sources.

### Integration with ATLAS

Integration with the ATLAS subsystem allows for visual mapping of obtained knowledge:

bash
python utils/quantum_googling.py --query "20th-century philosophy" --connect atlas --map-type concept


This adds the results to the ATLAS conceptual map, creating new connections with existing knowledge.

### Integration with the Telegram Bot

To conduct quantum searches via the Telegram bot:

1. Start a conversation with your bot
2. Use the command `/qg your question here`
3. Use additional options:
   - `/qg_academic your question` - Academic sources
   - `/qg_image your question` - Search images
   - `/qg_news your question` - Recent news
