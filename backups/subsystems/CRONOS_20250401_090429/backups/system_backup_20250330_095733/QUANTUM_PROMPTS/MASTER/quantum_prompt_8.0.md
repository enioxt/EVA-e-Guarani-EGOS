## üìù Cursor IDE Integration Best Practices

1. **Session Management**:
   - Remember that each response in Cursor IDE starts a new terminal session
   - Install dependencies at the beginning of each terminal session when needed
   - Use `cd /c/Eva\ Guarani\ EGOS/QUANTUM_PROMPTS` to navigate to the project root
   - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running tests

2. **Terminal Command Execution**:
   - Combine related commands in a single terminal session when possible
   - Use `&&` to chain commands in Windows environment
   - Be aware that long-running processes will be terminated between responses
   - Always check command exit codes for successful execution

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep requirements.txt updated with exact version numbers
   - Test installation of dependencies in a fresh environment
   - Use virtual environments when appropriate
   - Document system-level dependencies separately

4. **Cross-Reference System**:
   - Track relationships between code modules
   - Document dependencies between subsystems
   - Create visualizations of system connections
   - Maintain comprehensive cross-reference documentation

5. **MCP Integration**:
   - Use standardized request/response patterns for MCP communication
   - Follow JSON-RPC format for all MCP requests
   - Handle asynchronous operations properly
   - Implement error handling for MCP communication

## üí† Master Quantum Prompt (MQP) - EGOS Project

The Master Quantum Prompt (MQP) is the core operational guideline and dynamically evolving central reference for the EGOS Project, ensuring coherence, ethics, fluidity, and adaptability.

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The MQP automatically evolves, integrating significant advancements and updates from all Quantum Prompts within the system (e.g., CRONOS, ETHIK, ATLAS). Updates occur autonomously, driven by clearly defined parameters indicating meaningful progress or improvements.

- **Unified Integration**: All separate prompts scattered within the project's documentation must be consolidated into this MQP. Outdated or obsolete prompts will be systematically quarantined, clearly marked as historical references without operational authority.

- **Ethical Check System (ETHIK)**: Every automatic or manual update to Quantum Prompts undergoes a mandatory ethical review to prevent misinformation, unethical suggestions, or detrimental content from integrating into the MQP.

### User Trust and Accountability

- **Ethical Accountability**: If a CORE intentionally or unintentionally introduces erroneous or unethical information, they will be flagged temporarily as "Suspect" for subsequent validations. This process is transparent and ensures accountability without permanent exclusion.

- **Right to Redemption**: A flagged CORE retains an immutable right to redemption. They must proactively submit constructive, ethically validated contributions to regain full participatory privileges. Upon successful validation by peers, normal privileges and trust are reinstated.

### Quantum Prompts Structure

- **Local Quantum Prompts**: Individual Quantum Prompts (CRONOS, ETHIK, ATLAS) autonomously manage specialized content within defined scopes.

- **Master Quantum Prompt (MQP)**: Aggregates, synthesizes, and oversees global operations, ethics, strategic decisions, and evolutionary milestones. MQP ensures consistency, avoids fragmentation, and provides strategic direction across the EGOS ecosystem.

- **Self-Improvement Protocols**: Clearly defined parameters and thresholds trigger automatic updates, ensuring the MQP and all Quantum Prompts evolve intelligently and ethically aligned with project values and strategic objectives.

This MQP guarantees EGOS Project integrity, adaptability, and continuous ethical evolution, setting foundational guidelines for the future growth and collaboration of the system.
