# Quantum Knowledge System EVA & GUARANI

> "At the intersection of modular analysis, systemic mapping, and quantum ethics, we transcend dimensions of thought with methodological precision and unconditional love."

## 🌐 Overview

The Quantum Knowledge System was developed to allow the EVA & GUARANI bot to maintain its unique identity, personality, ethics, and knowledge even when using economical AI models. Instead of relying exclusively on expensive external models for all responses, the system first consults its own quantum knowledge base, retrieves relevant information, prepares a precise prompt, and only then uses an economical model to process the final response.

This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Identity Preservation**: Maintains the unique personality, tone, and values of EVA & GUARANI

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces reliance on premium models by intelligently using more economical models

3. **Ethical Responsiveness**: Ensures all responses are aligned with the system's ethical guidelines

4. **Contextual Knowledge**: Provides responses based on the system's own knowledge

5. **Consistent Experience**: Offers a consistent experience for users regardless of the model used

## 🔧 Main Components

The system is composed of three main components:

### 1. Quantum Knowledge Hub (quantum_knowledge_hub.py)

This is the core of the system, responsible for:

- Storing and indexing knowledge in a vector database

- Generating embeddings for queries and content

- Searching for relevant knowledge based on queries

- Providing contextual ethical guidelines

- Selecting appropriate personas for each interaction

- Preparing optimized prompts for economical models

### 2. Quantum Knowledge Integrator (quantum_knowledge_integrator.py)

This component acts as an intermediary between the bot and the knowledge hub:

- Connects the knowledge hub to the unified bot

- Manages communication between the bot and the knowledge system

- Determines the complexity of messages to choose appropriate models

- Processes messages through the knowledge system

- Logs metrics and usage logs

### 3. Integration Script (integrate_quantum_knowledge.py)

This script is responsible for integrating the entire system into the unified bot:

- Sets up the necessary environment and directories

- Creates content examples (prompts, ethical guidelines, personas)

- Modifies the bot code to incorporate the knowledge system

- Establishes the necessary connections between components

- Initializes and configures the entire ecosystem

## 📬 Message Processing Flow

When a message is received by the bot, the quantum knowledge system processes it as follows:

1. **Message Reception**: The bot receives a message from the user

2. **Forwarding to the Knowledge System**: The message is forwarded to the `quantum_knowledge_integrator`

3. **Complexity Determination**: The system analyzes the complexity of the message to decide which model to use

4. **Search for Relevant Knowledge**: The `quantum_knowledge_hub` searches for relevant knowledge for the query

5. **Obtaining Ethical Guidelines**: The system obtains contextually relevant ethical guidelines

6. **Persona Selection**: An appropriate persona is selected based on the context

7. **Quantum Prompt Preparation**: A detailed prompt is prepared with all the context and knowledge

8. **Processing with Economical Model**: The prompt is sent for processing with an economical model

9. **Adding Quantum Signature**: The EVA & GUARANI signature is added to the response if necessary

10. **Sending the Response**: The final response is sent to the user

  ],
  "signature": "🌱🌿🌳 Nature Guardian - EVA & GUARANI 🌳🌿🌱"
}


## 🗂️ How the Vector Database Works

The system uses an SQLite database to store vector embeddings, allowing efficient semantic search:

1. **Embedding Generation**: Texts are converted into vectors using the `text-embedding-3-small` model

2. **Storage**: Vectors are stored in the database along with metadata

3. **Search**: When a query is received, its embedding is compared with those stored

4. **Cosine Similarity**: Similarity is calculated using the cosine formula between vectors

5. **Filtering**: Results below the similarity threshold are discarded

6. **Sorting**: Results are sorted by relevance

## 🔍 Debugging and Maintenance

### System Logs

Logs are stored in separate files to facilitate debugging:

- `logs/quantum_knowledge.log`: Knowledge hub operations
- `logs/quantum_integrator.log`: Integrator operations
- `logs/quantum_integration.log`: Integration process

### Useful Maintenance Commands

1. **Reindex knowledge**:

   python
   from quantum_knowledge_hub import QuantumKnowledgeHub
   import asyncio
   
   async def reindex():
       hub = QuantumKnowledgeHub()
       count = await hub.index_quantum_prompts()
       print(f"Reindexed {count} quantum prompts")
       
   asyncio.run(reindex())
   

2. **Check system status**:

   python
   from quantum_knowledge_integrator import QuantumKnowledgeIntegrator
