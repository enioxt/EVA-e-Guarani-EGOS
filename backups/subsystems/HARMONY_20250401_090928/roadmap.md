# HARMONY Subsystem Roadmap

> Cross-Platform Compatibility - Last Updated: 2025-03-31

## üöÄ Current Sprint Tasks (1.0)

| Task ID | Description | Status | Dependencies | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| HARMONY-1.1 | Define core compatibility requirements | DONE | - | Covered in PRD docs/prd/harmony_compatibility.md |
| HARMONY-1.2 | Create directory structure for HARMONY | DONE | - | Created src/core/harmony |
| HARMONY-1.3 | Design platform detection interfaces | DONE | HARMONY-1.1 | Implemented IPlatformDetector in src/core/harmony/adapter.py |
| HARMONY-1.4 | Implement basic platform adapters | DONE | HARMONY-1.1 | Implemented IFileSystemAdapter, IUIAdapter, IConfigAdapter interfaces |
| HARMONY-1.5 | Create compatibility test framework | DONE | HARMONY-1.3 | Implemented ICompatibilityTester interface |

## üå± Short-term Goals (Sprints 2-3)

- Implement platform detection for Win/Mac/Linux
- Implement FileSystemAdapter for path normalization
- Implement basic compatibility tests (core startup, file paths)
- Integrate platform detection into startup sequence
- Document platform-specific handling guidelines

## üå≥ Medium-term Goals (Sprints 4-6)

- Implement UIAdapter for theme/font detection
- Implement ConfigAdapter for platform overrides
- Expand compatibility test suite coverage
- Integrate HARMONY checks into CI/CD pipeline
- Research mobile platform adaptation needs

## üå≤ Long-term Vision

- Automated compatibility issue detection and reporting
- Graceful degradation framework for unsupported platforms
- Platform-specific performance optimization hooks
- Extensible adapter system for new platforms/environments
- Integration with platform-native accessibility features

## üìä Implementation Progress

| Component | Progress | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Platform Detection | 30% | In Progress |
| File System Adapter | 30% | In Progress |
| UI Adapter | 20% | In Progress |
| Config Adapter | 20% | In Progress |
| Compatibility Testing | 35% | In Progress |

## üîÑ Integration Points

- **ATLAS**: Visualize compatibility test results and status
- **NEXUS**: Analyze code for platform-specific API usage
- **CRONOS**: Track compatibility changes over time
- **ETHIK**: Ensure ethical consistency across platforms
