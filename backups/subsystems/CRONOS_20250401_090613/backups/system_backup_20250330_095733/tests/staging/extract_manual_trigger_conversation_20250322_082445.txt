==================================================

[Human] (2025-03-22 08:24:45)
  How can I preserve conversations in Cursor?

[Human] (2025-03-22 08:24:45)
  That sounds great! How do I enable it?

[Assistant] (2025-03-22 08:24:45)
  EVA & GUARANI has a system for automatically preserving conversations.    The auto_context_integration.py module handles this by saving conversations    when sessions end and integrating with BIOS-Q for context awareness.

[Assistant] (2025-03-22 08:24:45)
  It's enabled by default. You can configure it in config/auto_context_config.json    to control things like automatic preservation, integration type, and debug options.
