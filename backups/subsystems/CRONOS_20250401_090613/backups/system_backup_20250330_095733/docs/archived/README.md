## Reason for Archiving



These files were archived as part of an optimization strategy for the EVA & GUARANI project documentation. The benefits of this approach include:



1. **Reduction of Fragmentation**: Elimination of documentation scattered across multiple files.

2. **Ease of Maintenance**: Updating information in a single location instead of multiple files.

3. **Content Consistency**: Avoiding contradictions or outdated information between different files.

4. **Systemic View**: Presenting the project as an integrated system, not as isolated components.

5. **Enhanced Navigation**: Facilitating information location with a detailed index and internal links.



## How to Access the Information



To access the content that was originally in these files:



1. Refer to the main document [UNIFIED_DOCUMENTATION.md](../UNIFIED_DOCUMENTATION.md)

2. Use the index at the beginning of the document to navigate to the relevant section

3. Use the search function of your text viewer to find specific terms
