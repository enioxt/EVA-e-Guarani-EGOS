# EVA & GUARANI - Quantum Unification Summary

## Process Completed

The quantum unification process has been completed successfully. The directory structure has been created, though there were challenges with copying source files due to ethical validation constraints.

## Directory Structure Created

- ATLAS/ - Systemic Cartography
- BIOS-Q/ - Basic Input/Output System - Quantum
- CRONOS/ - Evolutionary Preservation
- ETHIK/ - Ethical Framework
- METADATA/ - Metadata Management
- NEXUS/ - Modular Analysis
- MASTER/ - Central Coordination

## Next Steps

1. Fix ethical validation framework
2. Manually populate directories with required files
3. Update roadmap with implementation timeline
4. Initialize quantum prompts in each subsystem
5. Create unified documentation

## Roadmap Tasks

- [ ] Fix ethical validation issues in file processing
- [ ] Implement proper validation framework
- [ ] Review and correct file integrity checks
- [ ] Conduct quantum validation on all critical files
- [ ] Create backup restoration procedures
