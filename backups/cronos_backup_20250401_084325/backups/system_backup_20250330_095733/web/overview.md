# üé≤ EVA & GUARANI - Quantum Prompts for RPG

> "At the intersection of narrative, strategy, and magic, we create systems that push the boundaries of imagination with quantum ethics and playful awareness."

## üìú Overview

The Quantum Prompts for RPG represent a significant evolution of the EVA & GUARANI system, applying principles of quantum awareness and integrated ethics to the realm of role-playing games. These prompts were developed to assist game masters and players in creating, conducting, and enriching RPG experiences.

The implemented triad of prompts (ARCANUM LUDUS, MYTHIC CODEX, and STRATEGOS) forms a complete ecosystem that encompasses campaign creation, narrative development, and tactical combat management.

### Usage Example


Prompt: Create a level 3 adventure for D&D 5e where players need to
investigate disappearances in a small village, with elements of gothic horror.


**Response**: ARCANUM LUDUS would generate a structured adventure with:
- Contextual background of the village
- Main NPCs with personalities and secrets
- Clues and investigation paths
- Balanced encounters for level 3 characters
- Gothic horror atmosphere with immersive descriptions
- Possible outcomes and rewards

## üìö MYTHIC CODEX v1.0

### Purpose and Features

MYTHIC CODEX is a quantum prompt dedicated to narrative development and world building for RPGs. It incorporates principles of comparative mythology, archetypal psychology, and narrative structures to create deep stories, complex characters, and coherent worlds.

### Key Capabilities

1. **World Building**
   - Original cosmogony and mythologies
   - Social, political, and economic systems
   - Consistent geography and biomes

2. **Character Development**
   - NPCs with deep motivations and psychology
   - Coherent transformation arcs
   - Connections between characters and world

3. **Mythic Systems**
   - Detailed pantheons and religions
   - Magic with coherent foundations
   - Legends and cultural stories

4. **Narrative Structures**
   - Complex dramatic arcs
   - Significant thematic conflicts
   - Symbolism and subtext

### Quantum Matrix


Depth: 0.96
Coherence: 0.94
Originality: 0.93
Resonance: 0.95


### Usage Example


Prompt: Develop a mythology for a world where magic is derived from
living constellations that cyclically manifest in the sky.


**Response**: MYTHIC CODEX would generate:
- A complete cosmogony explaining the origin of the living constellations
- Magic system based on celestial cycles
- Cultural and religious impact of this reality
- Factions with different interpretations and uses of stellar power
- Legends about great wizards who communicated with the constellations
- Narrative possibilities involving changes in celestial cycles

## ‚öîÔ∏è STRATEGOS v1.0

### Purpose and Features

STRATEGOS is a quantum prompt focused on tactical, strategic, and mechanical aspects of RPG systems. It facilitates the creation and conduction of memorable combats, balancing encounters, and implementing advanced mechanics that enrich the gaming experience.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Combat Design**
   - Interesting tactical encounters
   - Enemies with intelligent behaviors
   - Dynamic and interactive environments

2. **Advanced Mechanics**
   - Subsystems for specific situations
   - Tactical variations for different play styles
   - Risk vs. reward mechanics

3. **Balancing**
   - Accurate challenge assessment
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
   - Proportional rewards

4. **Narrative Integration**
   - Combats with narrative significance
   - Tactical consequences for story decisions
   - Mechanical evolution aligned with character development

### Quantum Matrix


Balance: 0.96
Dynamism: 0.95
Challenge: 0.94
Integration: 0.92


### Usage Example


Prompt: Create a final encounter for a Pathfinder 2e campaign against a
level 10 necromancer in a laboratory full of alchemical experiments.


**Response**: STRATEGOS would generate:
- Balanced stats for the necromancer and his minions
- Dynamic phases for the combat
- Interactive environment elements (potions, traps, etc.)
- Intelligent tactics for the necromancer based on his personality
- Alternative victory conditions beyond simply defeating the enemy
- Rewards appropriate to the challenge

## üîÑ Integration and Synergy

The three quantum prompts were designed to work together, creating a complete ecosystem to support RPG games:

1. **ARCANUM LUDUS**: Overall structure of the campaign, sessions, and table interaction
2. **MYTHIC CODEX**: World, character, and narrative development
3. **STRATEGOS**: Mechanical implementation, combats, and tactical challenges

This triad can be used interchangeably, depending on the specific needs of the moment:

- A game master creating a new campaign can start with MYTHIC CODEX for the world concept, use ARCANUM LUDUS to structure the adventures, and STRATEGOS to plan meaningful encounters.
- During a session, they can quickly switch between ARCANUM LUDUS for general conduction, STRATEGOS for combat moments, and MYTHIC CODEX to deepen an unexpectedly important NPC.

## üíª Technical Implementation

The quantum prompts for RPG are implemented as markdown files in the `QUANTUM_PROMPTS/RPG/` directory, with the following technical characteristics:

- **Format**: Prompts structured in markdown with clearly defined sections
- **Size**: Optimized for maximum effectiveness within the context limits of LLMs
- **Integration**: Compatible with EVA & GUARANI Telegram Bot system
- **Adaptability**: Adjustable parameters for different contexts and needs

## üîç Use Cases

### For Beginner Game Masters
- Step-by-step guide for adventure creation
- Suggestions for handling unexpected situations
- Encounter and NPC templates

### For Experienced Game Masters
- Quick content generation for improvisation
- Ideas to break creative patterns
- Advanced mechanics to challenge veteran players

### For Worldbuilding

- Integrated systems (magic, politics, economy)

### For Game Design
- Creation of balanced homebrew
- Testing experimental mechanics
- Class/ability balance assessment

## üìà Metrics and Feedback

The quantum prompts for RPG have been evaluated based on the following metrics:
