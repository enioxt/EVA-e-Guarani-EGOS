# Versioning Strategy - EVA & GUARANI

This document defines the versioning strategy for the EVA & GUARANI system, establishing clear practices for version management, history preservation, and continuous system evolution.

## üìå Versioning Convention

The EVA & GUARANI system uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) in the format:


MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-QUALIFIER


Where:

- **MAJOR**: Versions that introduce changes incompatible with previous versions
- **MINOR**: Versions that add functionalities while maintaining compatibility
- **PATCH**: Versions that fix bugs while maintaining compatibility
- **QUALIFIER** (optional): State identifier (alpha, beta, rc, etc.)

### Examples:

- `7.0.0` - Stable major version
- `7.1.0` - New functionality added
- `7.1.1` - Bug fix
- `8.0.0-alpha.1` - Alpha version of the next major version

## üîÑ Evolution Process

### Version Lifecycle

1. **Development** (dev)
   - Active work on new functionalities
   - Versions identified with `-dev` (e.g., `7.2.0-dev`)

2. **Alpha**
   - Complete functionalities but not fully tested
   - Versions identified with `-alpha.N` (e.g., `7.2.0-alpha.1`)

3. **Beta**
   - Stable functionalities, in extensive testing
   - Versions identified with `-beta.N` (e.g., `7.2.0-beta.1`)

4. **Release Candidate (RC)**
   - Candidate version for final release
   - Versions identified with `-rc.N` (e.g., `7.2.0-rc.1`)

5. **Stable**
   - Official released version
   - No qualifiers (e.g., `7.2.0`)

6. **Maintenance**
   - Only critical fixes
   - Only PATCH increment (e.g., `7.2.1`)

## üõ°Ô∏è Backup and Preservation Policy

### Automatic Backup

The system implements automatic backup in the following situations:

1. **Daily Backup**
   - Performed once a day at 03:00h
   - Stored in: `./backup/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/`

2. **Pre-Version Backup**
   - Performed before each version change
   - Stored in: `./backup/version/vX.Y.Z/`

3. **Pre-Migration Backup**
   - Performed before data or structural migrations
   - Stored in: `./backup/migration/YYYY-MM-DD_description/`

### Backup Retention

- Daily backups: kept for 30 days
- Version backups: kept indefinitely
- Migration backups: kept for 90 days

## üìù Changelog

A `CHANGELOG.md` file is maintained at the root of the project, following the principles of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

### Changelog Structure

markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New functionalities not yet released

## [7.1.0] - 2025-03-15
### Added
- New functionality X
### Changed
- Improvement in functionality Y
### Fixed
- Bug fix Z


## üè∑Ô∏è Tags and Releases

Each stable version is marked with a Git tag:

bash
git tag -a v7.2.0 -m "Version 7.2.0"
git push origin v7.2.0


## üåø Branch Strategy

- `main` - Contains code of the current stable version
- `develop` - Contains code in development for the next version
- `feature/*` - Branches for new functionality development
- `release/*` - Branches for release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for the stable version

## üì¶ Version Artifacts

For each stable version, the following artifacts are generated and archived:

1. Complete source code
2. Documentation in PDF format
3. Checksum file for integrity verification
4. Metadata record (date, authors, main changes)

## üîÑ Version Compatibility

Version compatibility is maintained according to these principles:

1. **Upward Compatibility** - Newer versions must support data from previous versions
2. **Automated Migrations** - Migration scripts to update data structures
3. **Support Period** - Each MAJOR version is supported for at least 12 months
4. **Deprecation Notice** - Features to be removed are marked as deprecated for at least one MINOR version before

## üåê Environments

- **Development** - For active work on new functionalities
- **Testing** - For integration and QA testing
- **Staging** - For final validation before production
- **Production** - Real system usage environment
