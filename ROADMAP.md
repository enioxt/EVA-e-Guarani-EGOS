## ❗ CRITICAL BLOCKERS & RECOVERY PHASE (Immediate Focus)

### 1. Resolve Immediate Test Blocker (NEXUS) [RESOLVED]
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED** (Fixed Logger Import, Mycelium Import, Dependency Logic, Complexity Calc)
-   **Issue:** Tests fail during collection (`pytest`) due to `ImportError: cannot import name 'KoiosLogger' from 'subsystems.KOIOS.core.logging'`. Follow-up errors included `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mycelium'`, `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'topic'`, and various `AssertionError`s related to dependency structure and complexity calculation.
-   **Diagnosis:** Initial issue was incorrect import path for logger. Subsequent issues involved using an outdated `src/core/mycelium.py` instead of the `MyceliumInterface` from the `subsystems/MYCELIUM/` directory, incorrect dependency dictionary structure, faulty relative/absolute import resolution for reverse dependencies, and flawed complexity calculation logic in `ast_visitor.py`.
-   **Resolution:** Corrected Koios logger import, deleted outdated `src/core/mycelium.py`, refactored NEXUS core and tests to use `MyceliumInterface`, fixed dependency analysis logic (output structure, import formatting, path resolution), and refactored complexity calculation in `ast_visitor.py`. All NEXUS tests are now passing.

### 2. Resolve Terminal Environment Issues [RESOLVED]
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED** - Workaround identified (prefix commands with `cd ... &&` and use explicit `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). Strategy documented in KOIOS Process Refinements.

### 3. Complete Subsystem Diagnostics [COMPLETED]
-   **Status:** **COMPLETED** - Diagnostics performed for all subsystems. KOIOS backup prompts not found in checked location. NEXUS backup core listed.

### 4. Subsystem Recovery & Migration Plan [CRITICAL - IN PROGRESS]
-   **Goal:** Review historical code/docs from backups and integrate the most advanced/correct versions into the current `subsystems/` structure.
-   **Priority Order:** CRONOS, ETHIK, KOIOS, ATLAS, NEXUS.
-   **Action (CRONOS):** Integrate essential scripts (`backup_manager.py`, verification logic) and core logic (`cronos_core.py`, `preservation.py`) into `CronosService`. Implement Restore logic. **Status: Core logic & Restore implementation complete & tested.**
-   **Action (ETHIK):** Migrate framework, rules, validators, etc. from backup. **Status: Recovery Complete (Validator & Sanitizer core logic, Mycelium integration, Service class). Testing substantial.**
-   **Action (KOIOS):** No recovery needed from checked backup. Proceed based on current structure. **Status: Confirmed.**
-   **Action (ATLAS):** Migrate core logic, docs, tests from backups. **Status: Recovery Complete (Core).** Steps: 1. Locate Backups [DONE]. 2. Analyze Components [DONE]. 3. Migrate & Integrate `AtlasCartographer` [DONE]. 4. Add Config, Tests, Docs [DONE]. 5. Refine Docs & Implement Visualization [NEXT].
-   **Action (NEXUS):** Migrate core logic, integrations, tests from backups. **Status: In Progress.** Steps: 1. Locate Backups [DONE]. 2. Analyze Components [DONE]. 3. Migrate & Refactor `nexus_core.py`, Create `NexusService` [DONE]. 4. Add Config, Tests, Docs [DONE]. 5. Resolve Test Blocker & Execute Tests [DONE]. 6. Refine Core Logic (AST Parsing, Dependency Accuracy) & Docs [NEXT].

### 7. Standardize Structure & Cleanup [IN PROGRESS]
-   **Action:** Removed legacy `src/` directory and its contents to consolidate code within the `subsystems/` structure according to KOIOS standards. Verified no critical `src.` imports remain. [DONE]

## 🎯 Near-Term Priorities (Post-Recovery Q2/Q3 2025)

*Order revised based on current blocker & dependencies:*

1.  **Refine NEXUS Core Logic [HIGH]:** Focus on improving AST Parsing accuracy (if needed beyond current state) and Dependency Analysis precision. Add comprehensive documentation.
2.  **Complete ATLAS Recovery [HIGH]:** Finalize by refining documentation & implementing core visualization features.
3.  **Complete CRONOS Implementation [CRITICAL]:** Implement Restore logic, finalize documentation (incl. SOPs), add more tests. [Restore Logic Done] Finalize documentation (incl. SOPs), review tests.
4.  **Finalize ETHIK [MEDIUM]:** Add basic documentation (READMEs), refine interaction if needed.
5.  **System Standardization [CRITICAL]:** (Partly concurrent) Finalize directory structure, implement KOIOS standards.
6.  **KOIOS Evolution [CRITICAL]:** Develop search, documentation generation (incl. PDDs, PRDs, `.cursorrules`), MDC/ADR support etc.
7.  **Define Visual Identity & Website Plan [HIGH]**: Establish EGOS brand guidelines and outline structure/features for the integrated website.
8.  **Mycelial Network Integration (Pilot) [CRITICAL]:** Plan BIOS-Q integration, connect pilot subsystem (e.g., KOIOS).
9.  **Define Initial Target Offering/Use Case [HIGH]:** Identify MVP (Informed by strategic goals like Ethical Agent Infra, Visual Knowledge Cartography).
10. **Prioritize CORUJA Development [HIGH]:** Implement core logic based on Target Offering. Analyze paelladoc commands/modes.

### KOIOS Problem-Solving Process

To address challenges consistently and maintain system integrity, the following KOIOS-aligned process should be followed:

1.  **Identification & Logging:** Clearly describe the issue, errors, context, and steps to reproduce. Log the issue.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis (NEXUS):** Use diagnostic tools (`list_dir`, `read_file`, `grep_search`, logs, `git status`) to find the origin.
3.  **Information Gathering (KOIOS/ATLAS):** Consult relevant documentation (READMEs, Roadmaps, specific docs), configs, metadata, and potentially CRONOS backups. Map related dependencies.
4.  **Solution Design & Ethical Validation (ETHIK):** Propose solutions and evaluate them against EGOS ethical principles (integrity, security, data respect).
5.  **Implementation & Standardization (KOIOS):** Apply the solution using appropriate tools (`edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`), adhering to KOIOS standards (naming, structure, style).
6.  **Verification & Testing (NEXUS/ETHIK):** Confirm the fix resolves the original issue. Run relevant tests.
7.  **Documentation Update (KOIOS):** Update all affected documentation (READMEs, roadmaps, guides, code docs). Ensure metadata is correct.
8.  **Preservation (CRONOS):** Commit changes to version control. Consider a CRONOS backup for significant structural changes.

### KOIOS Process Refinements

-   **File/Directory Access Strategy:** When accessing file contents or directory listings, prioritize dedicated tools (`read_file`, `list_dir`). If these tools timeout or fail unexpectedly for a likely valid path, fall back to using the terminal (`run_terminal_cmd` with `cat <path>` or `ls -R <path>`) to retrieve the information before proceeding.
-   **Terminal Command Execution Strategy:** Due to observed inconsistencies in the shell's Current Working Directory (CWD) between tool calls, **always prefix terminal commands** run via `run_terminal_cmd` with `cd /c/Eva\ Guarani\ EGOS/ && ` (adjust path if workspace root changes) to ensure commands execute from the expected project root, unless a different CWD is specifically needed for the command's operation.
-   **Terminal Python Execution Strategy:** To reliably execute Python within the virtual environment, use the explicit path after changing directory: `cd /c/Eva\ Guarani\ EGOS/ && .venv/Scripts/python.exe <script_or_module_args>`.
-   **Chat Session Strategy:** Consider starting new chats for distinct major tasks/phases to manage context size, balancing with the need for history continuity in ongoing efforts like recovery.
-   **Workflow Integration:** Incorporate dedicated Security Review and Code Review steps into standard development and problem-solving workflows.
