## üéØ Immediate Priorities (Q2 2025)

+ ## üéØ Next 10+ Actionable Steps (Focus for Today - 2025-04-04)
+
+ This section outlines the immediate, concrete tasks derived from the Q2 priorities, intended to guide development focus. *Status updated 2025-04-04.*
+
+ 1.  **Code Quality:** Fix persistent pre-commit hook failures (E501/F841 loop with formatters). Investigate configuration conflict between `ruff`, `black`, `ruff-format`. *[PAUSED - Blocked by formatter conflicts. Proceeding with root dir cleanup.]*
+ 2.  **Project Structure:** Organize root directory files. Move logs, scripts, temporary files, and planning documents to appropriate locations (`logs/`, `scripts/`, `docs/temp/`, `docs/planning/`, `.cursor/`, `docs/archive/roadmaps/`). Rename `Researchs` to `research`. *[COMPLETED - 2025-04-04]*
+ 3.  **CRONOS:** Finalize documentation for `backup_manager.py`, including creating standard operating procedures (SOPs) in `subsystems/CRONOS/docs/procedures.md`, and review existing tests for completeness. *[IN PROGRESS - Placeholder added to procedures.md for final review]*
+ 4.  **Standardization/KOIOS:** Implement the Naming Convention Validator script/tool. Create the initial file structure and define basic validation logic. *[COMPLETED - 2025-04-04: Initial script `validation/naming_validator.py` and tests `tests/test_naming_validator.py` created and passing (90% script coverage).]*
+ 5.  **Standardization/KOIOS:** Begin implementing the Metadata Validation script/tool. Create the initial file structure and define how it will load schemas and validate file metadata.
+ 6.  **KOIOS:** Define the Standard for Script Feedback. Create the initial `docs/STANDARDS_SCRIPT_FEEDBACK.md` outlining guidelines for logging levels and progress indicators (e.g., using `tqdm` or `rich`). *[DONE - Initial draft created]*
+ 7.  **KOIOS:** Begin Semantic Search implementation research. Identify potential Python libraries (e.g., sentence-transformers, FAISS) and outline the core search mechanism.
+ 8.  **Standardization:** Plan the Directory Structure Migration in detail. Document the specific mapping of files/folders from `QUANTUM_PROMPTS` to their target subsystems in a temporary planning file or section within the roadmap/KOIOS docs.
+ 9.  **Mycelium:** Plan BIOS-Q integration for the Mycelium Network instance. Define the requirements, interaction points, and configuration needed within BIOS-Q to manage the network connection.
+ 10. **ETHIK:** Refine `EthikSanitizer` Core Logic. Review `subsystems/ETHIK/core/sanitizer.py` for potential optimizations, enhanced rule condition handling, or better integration with newly defined KOIOS standards (logging, error handling).
+ 11. **NEXUS:** Refine `NEXUSCore` Dependency Analysis. *[IN PROGRESS]* Review/enhance dependency logic (`analyze_dependencies`, `_path_to_module_str`) in `subsystems/NEXUS/core/nexus_core.py`. *[NOTE ADDED - Clarification needed for Service/Analyzer roles, see NEXUS/README.md]*
+ 12. **Market Fit/MQP:** Integrate Philosophical Notes into `docs/MQP.md`. Weave core concepts (reconnecting, direction, quantum ethics) more explicitly into the MQP's introduction or a dedicated philosophy section.
+ 13. **Documentation Enhancement (MQP Alignment):** Systematically review key subsystem READMEs (`CRONOS`, `ETHIK`, `KOIOS`, `NEXUS`, `MYCELIUM`) to add practical code examples where lacking. *[IN PROGRESS - CRONOS, ETHIK, KOIOS, MYCELIUM updated/created]*

### KOIOS Problem-Solving Process

To address challenges consistently and maintain system integrity, the following KOIOS-aligned process should be followed:

1.  **Identification & Logging:** Clearly describe the issue, errors, context, and steps to reproduce. Log the issue.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis (NEXUS):** Use diagnostic tools (`list_dir`, `read_file`, `grep_search`, logs, `git status`) to find the origin.
3.  **Information Gathering (KOIOS/ATLAS):** Consult relevant documentation (READMEs, Roadmaps, specific docs), configs, metadata, and potentially CRONOS backups. Map related dependencies.
4.  **Solution Design & Ethical Validation (ETHIK):** Propose solutions and evaluate them against EGOS ethical principles (integrity, security, data respect).
5.  **Implementation & Standardization (KOIOS):** Apply the solution using appropriate tools (`edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`), adhering to KOIOS standards (naming, structure, style).
6.  **Verification & Testing (NEXUS/ETHIK):** Confirm the fix resolves the original issue. Run relevant tests.
7.  **Documentation Update (KOIOS):** Update all affected documentation (READMEs, roadmaps, guides, code docs). Ensure metadata is correct.
8.  **Preservation (CRONOS):** Commit changes to version control. Consider a CRONOS backup for significant structural changes.

### KOIOS Process Refinements

-   **File/Directory Access Strategy:** When accessing file contents or directory listings, prioritize dedicated tools (`read_file`, `list_dir`). If these tools timeout or fail unexpectedly for a likely valid path, fall back to using the terminal (`run_terminal_cmd` with `cat <path>` or `ls -R <path>`) to retrieve the information before proceeding.
-   **Terminal Command Execution Strategy:** Due to observed inconsistencies in the shell's Current Working Directory (CWD) between tool calls, **always prefix terminal commands** run via `run_terminal_cmd` with `cd /c/Eva\ Guarani\ EGOS/ && ` (adjust path if workspace root changes) to ensure commands execute from the expected project root, unless a different CWD is specifically needed for the command's operation.
-   **Terminal Python Execution Strategy:** To reliably execute Python within the virtual environment, use the explicit path after changing directory: `cd /c/Eva\ Guarani\ EGOS/ && .venv/Scripts/python.exe <script_or_module_args>`.
-   **Chat Session Strategy:** Consider starting new chats for distinct major tasks/phases to manage context size, balancing with the need for history continuity in ongoing efforts like recovery.
-   **Workflow Integration:** Incorporate dedicated Security Review and Code Review steps into standard development and problem-solving workflows.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. All new development must follow KOIOS standardization guidelines
2. English-only policy is mandatory for all content
3. Metadata must be complete and validated
4. Cross-system integration through Mycelial Network
5. Regular metrics updates required
6. Windows compatibility must be maintained

## üìà Market Fit & Go-to-Market Strategy (NEW - Early Focus)

**Goal:** Ensure EGOS development aligns with market needs and establishes a path towards sustainability and potential monetization. This must be considered concurrently with technical development.

**Core Questions to Address (Ongoing Task - Target Q3 2025 for Initial Answers):**

1.  **Value Proposition & Differentiation:**
    *   What unique problems does EGOS solve? (e.g., Integrated Ethical AI Dev Env, Advanced Knowledge Cartography, Bio-Inspired Resilience, AI-Assisted Ethical Transactions)
    *   How is it significantly better than competitors? (Quantifiable benefits? Feature comparison?)
2.  **Target Customer Segments:**
    *   Identify primary and secondary customer profiles (e.g., AI Startups, Enterprise IT, Research Institutions, Ethical Consumers/Businesses).
    *   What are their specific pain points EGOS addresses?
    *   **Define detailed User Personas.**
3.  **Competitive Landscape:**
    *   Identify key competitors in relevant spaces (AI platforms, KM tools, ethical frameworks, blockchain transaction platforms).
    *   Analyze their offerings, features, pricing, GTM strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.
4.  **Monetization Model Exploration & Design:**
    *   Evaluate potential models (Open Core, SaaS, Services, Marketplace, Transaction Fees).
    *   **Design detailed Usage-Based Billing mechanics:** Define metrics, tracking mechanisms (Mycelium/KOIOS?).
    *   **Design ETHIK Gamification System:** Define rules for earning points, potential rewards/discounts, integration with transaction system.
    *   **Design Network Incentive/Fee Structure:** Model the discount mechanism, fee allocation (network maintenance, tiered contributions).
    *   **Define Crypto-Fiat Gateway Requirements.**
    *   Analyze pricing strategies and average ticket sizes in comparable markets.
5.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition:**
    *   Define the smallest feature set delivering core value to an initial target segment.
    *   Align MVP with existing subsystems (e.g., KOIOS+NEXUS, ETHIK+Mycelium, CORUJA+AI Assistant).
6.  **Target Platform & User Experience:**
    *   **Define initial target platform(s):** Web App, Desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Mobile (Android/iOS), SDK, Standalone CLI?
    *   **Map the full Customer Journey:** Discovery -> Onboarding (Login/Account) -> Usage -> Support -> Offboarding.
    *   **Develop early Frontend Mockups/Prototypes (ATLAS/CORUJA Task).**
7.  **Go-to-Market (GTM) Plan:**
    *   Outline initial strategies for reaching target customers (content, community, partnerships, direct outreach).
    *   Estimate time-to-market for the defined MVP.
